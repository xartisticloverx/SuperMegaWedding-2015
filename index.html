FBI profiling is something I've always had an interest in, but never done much reading on. I must change this.

                    <p><strong>Spring 2011</strong>, there was still a left over chill in the air from a fairly mild Ohio winter.</p>
                    <p>The location: <strong>Rancho Allegre</strong>. Quesadillas were eaten, margaritas drank, and (unknowingly) the foundation laid for a love of the ages. </p>
                    <p>After an initial string of conversations about everything from FBI profiling to puppy herding and the fine art of naps, we started to hang out and find that we had even more in common than expected. </p>
                    <p>Date one led to date two, and three, and before we knew it, we were discussing moving in together. <br/ >
                    With the addition of another puppy, we knew we were in it for the <strong>long haul</strong>. </p>
                    <p>After a few months of Kyle’s foot <strong>dragging</strong>, he finally took a deep breath and anxiously dropped to one knee. Since you’re reading this on the site for our upcoming wedding; you can see how that one turned out!</p>

                <p>Kyle and I just wanted to send out a <strong>thanks</strong> to <strong>everyone</strong> for every single piece of love and support we have received. There is definitely a <strong>special</strong> thanks that is needed to be sent our <strong>parents</strong> - the unconditional moral support and financial support is helping make our special day even <strong>MORE</strong> special. Another thanks sent out to our <strong><a href="#our-party" title="bridal party">bridal party</a></strong> who have helped keep us sane and continuing to make us smile through out this entire process. One last personal shout out to my late mom, <strong>Robbin</strong>. While I am heartbroken that you will not be able to physically be apart of our day, I know you are watching over me, Carolyn and dad (Abby, Ziva and Shredder too!). We all know how much you would have loved Kyle and that is enough for me to know that you will always be with us.</p>
